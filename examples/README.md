## Markdown

This is a simple example of the TS Playground GitHub Block embedded in Markwdown.

<BlockComponent
block={{"owner":"hideoo","repo":"ts-playground-block","id":"ts-playground-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"owner":"hideoo","repo":"ts-playground-block","path":"examples/basic.ts","sha":"HEAD","file":"examples/README.md"}}
/>

This is another example with the height set to 300px in the markdown.

<BlockComponent
block={{"owner":"hideoo","repo":"ts-playground-block","id":"ts-playground-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"owner":"hideoo","repo":"ts-playground-block","path":"examples/basic.ts","sha":"HEAD","file":"examples/README.md"}}
height={300}
/>
