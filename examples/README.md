## File Renderer

The following examples use the TS Playground GitHub Block as a file renderer on GitHub:

- [Basic TypeScript file](https://blocks.githubnext.com/HiDeoo/ts-playground-block/blob/main/examples/basic.ts)
- [Basic TypeScript file with a specific TypeScript version](https://blocks.githubnext.com/HiDeoo/ts-playground-block/blob/main/examples/version.ts)

## Markdown

This is a simple example of the TS Playground GitHub Block embedded in Markdown. You can check the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HiDeoo/ts-playground-block/main/examples/README.md) to see the Markdown syntax.
